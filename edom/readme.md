# EDOM


In this folder you should add **all** artifacts developed in exercises and projects of the EDOM course.

### Structure of Folders

You should create a subfolder for each exercise or project. For instance, subfolder "exercise1" will contain all the artifacts for exercise 1 of edom; subfolder "exercise2" will contain all the artifacts for exercise 2 of edom; subfolder "project" will contain all the artifacts of the final project of "edom", etc.  

**Note:** If for some reason you need to bypass these guidelines please ask for directions with your teacher and **always** state the exceptions in your commits and issues in bitbucket.
